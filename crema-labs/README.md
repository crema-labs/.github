# Crema Labs

Crema is a blockchain R&D studio. We focus on zk, DeFi, and Bitcoin SPV bridges. The organization was started by [Yash](https://github.com/yash1o), [Ayman](https://github.com/nesopie), [Vikas](https://github.com/0xvikasrushi), and [Reventh](https://github.com/Revantark) from the Core Catalog.fi team. We hack on weekends and are currently focused on implementing cryptographic primitives in Circom.
